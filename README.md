# Cotton Plant Disease Classification Web Application

## Problem Statement
Diseases found in Agricultural crops are a major threat that causes production and economic losses as well as
reduction in both quality and quantity of agricultural products. In India, 70% of the population depends on
agriculture which contributes about 17% of the total GDP of our country. Cotton is a very important cash crop
in India. Farmers have difficulty switching from one disease control policy to another. It is difficult for the
human eye to identify the exact type of leaf disease that occurs on the plant leaves, which also requires constant
monitoring of experts, which can be prohibitively expensive on large farms.
Expert naked eye observation is the
main approach adopted and used in practice to detect plant diseases. With the help of the Deep CNN model, we
can use images processing techniques to analyze dead leaf images and extract the features such as color,
texture, and other characteristics. 

The aim is to develop algorithms and techniques based on images of leaves or other plant features that can automatically detect
and classify agricultural plant diseases. This can help farmers to assist and manage the disease.
